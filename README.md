# 2D_Beam_Statics
### Calculation of truss structures (simple beams and nodes)
A revival of my statics calculator from 2014. I try to transform the source code into a maven project.
The application solves a planar structure and shows the deformation. The results for the beams and nodes are stored in a table. 
* mechanical property: elastic linear
* boundary conditions: free in x- or y-direction, fixed, force
* calculation of the deformed structure
* Solving a linear system with the library [Jama](https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/)
